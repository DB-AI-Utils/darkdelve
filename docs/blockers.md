## Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Architect Phase)

### ~~B-030: Item Template Gap~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `rpg-game-designer`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** MVP item target reduced from 50+ to 20-25 items. Current 20 designed items are sufficient for MVP. Epic and Legendary rarities deferred to post-MVP.

---

### ~~B-027: Floor 3 Mechanic Stacking~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `progression-pacing-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Moved Armored Ghoul floor range from 3-4 to 4-5. Updated enemy stats in `reference-numbers.md` and enemy composition pools in `dungeon-generation.md`. Floor 3 now introduces only Waystone cost; Floor 4 introduces armored enemies alongside Shadow Stalker.

---

### ~~B-028: Ghoul HP Too Low~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `game-balance-tuner`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Increased Ghoul HP from 18-22 to 22-26 in `reference-numbers.md`. TTK now aligns with 3-4 turn target for starter Mercenary.

---

### ~~B-029: Lesson Learned Duration Inconsistency~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Changed save schema example from `runsRemaining: 2` to `runsRemaining: 1` in `save-system.md` to match `death-discovery.md` specification.

---

## Edge Cases Requiring Specification

### ~~E-001: Extraction Interruption~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Extraction Atomicity" rule to `extraction-system.md`: extraction is atomic and completes regardless of damage; if HP would reach 0, player extracts at 1 HP ("barely survived").

---

### ~~E-002: Full Inventory When Loot Drops~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Full Inventory Handling" rule to `items.md` Loot Generation section: loot remains in room, player can return after freeing space, room state persists until run ends.

---

### ~~E-003: Cursed Item Death Recovery~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Cursed Item Death Recovery" subsection to `items.md` Cursed Item Mechanics: cursed items follow standard death recovery rules; curse persists on the item.

---

### ~~E-004: Same Shrine Blessing Re-selected~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Same Blessing Re-selection" rule to `events.md` Shrine Events section: selecting current blessing has no effect, displays "You already bear this blessing."

---

### ~~E-005: Extraction With No Gold AND No Items~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Desperation Extraction" rule to `extraction-system.md`: player may sacrifice equipped item (except weapon); if only weapon remains, extraction is free but inflicts +20 Dread.

---

### ~~E-006: Watcher Escape Window Distance~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Stun Window Movement Rules" to `dread-system.md` Watcher Stun Mechanics: Watcher is immobilized during stun, player moves freely, Watcher resumes from last position (no teleport).

---

## Documentation Fixes

### ~~D-001: Bone Knight TTK Target~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `game-balance-tuner`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Updated Balance Validation Checklist in `reference-numbers.md` to show "4-5 (with Heavy)" instead of "3-4 (with Heavy)" to match actual math.

---

### ~~D-002: Shrine Room Type Clarification~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Shrine Placement" clarification to `dungeon-structure.md` Room Types section: shrines appear within EVENT rooms as part of the event pool.

---

### ~~D-003: XP Calculation Assumptions~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `game-balance-tuner`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "XP Calculation Assumptions" documentation to `reference-numbers.md` after XP Design Principle, explaining ~60% combat rooms, ~10 encounters per standard run, 10-15% elite spawn rate on Floors 3-4.

---

### ~~D-004: Dread Event Frequency~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `game-balance-tuner`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Expected Event Contribution" documentation to `dread-system.md` Dread Sources section, specifying 1-2 Dread-generating events per run contributing +10-20 Dread to reach 40-60 target range.

---

### ~~D-005: Consumable Stacking Rules~~ RESOLVED
**Agent:** `rpg-game-designer`
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-01-15)

**Resolution:** Added "Consumable Stacking" subsection to `character-progression.md` Inventory System section with stacking rules, 5-per-slot cap, and design rationale.

---

## Concerns to Monitor (Not Blockers)

### C-001: Level 10-15 Content Lull
**Agent:** `progression-pacing-auditor`
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Highest XP requirements with fewest new unlocks may cause engagement drop.

**Recommendation:** Add item pool milestone at Level 12 (e.g., 22 items instead of waiting for Level 15).

---

### C-002: Class Unlocks May Be Too Fast
**Agent:** `progression-pacing-auditor`
**Priority:** LOW

**Issue:** Both classes unlock in 4-8 hours. May reduce variety pacing.

**Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. Consider third class with harder unlock if engagement drops after both classes obtained.

---

### C-003: First-Time Dread Explanation
**Agent:** `rpg-game-designer`
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** When player first hits 50 Dread and sees corrupted information, no in-game explanation that this IS corruption.

**Recommendation:** Add first-crossing message: "Your mind wavers. The dungeon's whispers grow louder. Can you trust your eyes?"

---

### C-004: Shadow Stalker "Blindside" Feel
**Agent:** `progression-pacing-auditor`
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** First Shadow Stalker encounter (28-36 ambush damage) may feel unfair.

**Recommendation:** Add Floor 4 entry flavor text: "The shadows here move with purpose. Watch your back."

---

### C-005: Boss Scaling at High Levels
**Agent:** `mechanics-auditor`
**Priority:** LOW

**Issue:** Level 20 pure MIGHT build kills boss in ~4 turns (target 8-12).

**Recommendation:** Monitor in playtesting. If boss trivializes, add scaling: `HP = 100 + (PlayerLevel - 10) * 5` for levels 11+.

---

### C-006: Post-Boss Extraction UX
**Agent:** `rpg-game-designer`
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** After defeating boss, the climactic moment lacks UI specification. What does player see?

**Recommendation:** Add post-boss flow specification to `dungeon-structure.md`:
1. Victory celebration display
2. Boss loot reveal
3. Watcher spawn check (if Dread was 100+)
4. Extraction prompt

---

### C-007: Early-Game ID Friction
**Agent:** `rpg-game-designer`
**Priority:** LOW

**Issue:** ID cost (25g) vs starting gold (50g) may frustrate new players returning with multiple unidentified items.

**Recommendation:** Consider free first identification, or reduce cost to 15g for first 3 runs.
